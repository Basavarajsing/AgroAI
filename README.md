## 📌 Project Overview
**AI-Powered Early Warning and Management of Crop Diseases** is a digital platform that helps **smallholder farmers** detect plant diseases early and receive **localized, sustainable guidance**.  
It uses **AI-driven image recognition**, **weather/soil data**, and **SMS/offline-first features** to ensure farmers in **low-connectivity rural areas** can still access **timely support**.

This project contributes directly to the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**
- **SDG 1:** No Poverty  
- **SDG 2:** Zero Hunger  
- **SDG 3:** Good Health & Well-being  
- **SDG 12:** Responsible Consumption & Production

## ✨ Key Features
- 📷 **AI-based crop disease detection** from plant leaf images  
- 🌍 **Localized advisory system** (multi-language + region-specific solutions)  
- 📡 **Offline-first support** (works with low connectivity, via SMS/USSD integration)  
- 🌱 **Sustainable guidance** to reduce chemical fertilizer/pesticide use  
- 📊 **Farmer dashboard** with insights on crop health, weather, and soil

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (or React Native for mobile), TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **AI/ML Models:** Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch, CNNs for image classification)  
- **Messaging:** Twilio / Vonage for SMS, PWA for offline use
